Welcome to landle, a straight-up ripoff of ghsync which wouldn't work for me.

It'll organize your repos like so:

+ repos
      forks    (public fork repos)
      mirrors  (public mirror repos)
      private  (private repos)
      public   (public repos)
      starred  (public watched repos)
      watched  (public watched repos)
